\chapter{Appendix: Network Architecture Diagrams}
\label{sec:appendix-network-diagrams}

This section includes the high-resolution network architecture and deployment diagrams used throughout the thesis. These diagrams were manually created using \textbf{draw.io} to illustrate the setup of the Aether platform, including Kubernetes networking, VirtualBox VM topology, UPF deployment models, and routing configurations.

All diagrams are available in both .SVG and editable \texttt{.drawio} formats. Readers can download and reuse these resources for replication or adaptation purposes.
